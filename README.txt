Arturo is a hand-motion, driven bluetooth vehicle. It is composed of two Arduino uno boards- one for controlling the vehicle and the other for the remote controller. An accelerometer device translates the user’s hand motions into input for the remote controller. A bluetooth module connects the vehicle and remote controllers to the operating user. The vehicle has the ability to move left, right, backwards, and forwards. These motions are dictated by the hand motions that a user generates with the remote control. With the hand-motion driven vehicle, the need for a button remote is eliminated. This may be of use to users with physical disabilities.
